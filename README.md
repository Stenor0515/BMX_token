# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

1. You should replace the contents of .secret file as your account private key.
2. Please run "yarn deploy" to deploy the contract on mainnet.
3. Please run "yarn deploy-testnet" to deploy the contract on testnet.
